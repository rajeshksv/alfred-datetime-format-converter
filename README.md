alfred-datetime-format-converter
================================

Alfred 2 workflow for converting between timestamps and formatted datetime strings with ease.

Same as parent except with following changes
* Use ts - timestamp as keyword instead of df
* Display time in IST and remove other unnecessary displays
* ts now takes epoch millis also. Well, all it just strips and converts into epoch seconds.
